The source code can be found inside the file spamOrNotSpam.R. The code can be run with RStudio.

To run the code the following packages have to be installed:
- tm
- wordcloud
- SnowballC
- RWeka
- ggplot2
- reshape2
- sentimentr
- qdap
- e1071
- gmodels
- RTextTools
- caret

Note: In line 19 the working directory is set. However, it could be that for some versions of RStudio the line is not working. If it is not working, the working directory needs to be set manually. In this case the commented line 22 should be uncommented and the path to the directory with the emails.csv should be entered as path.

Other than that, the code can be run normally within RStudio.
